    "Luxembourg is a small country, located literally in the middle of Europe - between France and Germany. Luxembourg hosts European head quarters of several big IT companies such as, for exmaple, Amazon, or various bodies of European Comission. These entities are important employers, and they cannot rely on Luxembourg local labor market. As a result, they keep bringing workers from abroad in order to satisfy their staffing requirements."
